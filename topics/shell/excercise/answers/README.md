# Make it executable:

- In the terminal, navigate to the directory where you saved your script.
- Run the command `chmod +x generate_password.sh` This command adds execute permissions to the script.

# Run it with the desired password length as an argument:

- After making the script executable, you can run it by providing the desired password length as a command-line argument.
- Use the following syntax: `./generate_password.sh <password_length>` , replacing `<password_length>` with the actual length you want.

Here's an example:

```shell
./generate_password.sh 12
```

This will execute the script (**generate_password.sh**) with a password length of **12**, and the script will generate and print a random password of that length. Adjust the length as needed based on your requirements.
